Netgun is as a very simple barebones MongoDB UI.

Currently availible MongoDB UIs are all lacking in at least one of the following areas

  * Mongo 3.0 support
  * Accepting connection strings in the [standard format](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/connection-string/)
  * Replica set support

Netgun was created with the goal of providing these features in a basic package.
